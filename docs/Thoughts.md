# What am I trying to achieve?

- Mostly this project should be an experiment in dev ops, at least for now. That's what I'm enjoying.
- But there's a presentation layer, this should at least be interesting useful information.
- Designng a backend API to make it easy to consume the data from the frontend.
- Maybe I should be using GraphQL :heart_eyes:

I'm thinking:

- Sort news sources into columns, showing current/today's news.

## Features:

- Get current from source
- Get today from source

From these, we can create word clouds.
That can be done on the backend.

- Get at time/time range.
- For large ranges - you reduce to word cloud, or animated word cloud?

### Small things:

- Display total number of documents, number of sources, etc.

## Other

- I need to work out how to compress this data.
- Or not. Maybe this was running every 15 seconds for ages.
